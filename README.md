# SQL project to analyze online music store data

This is biggner level project to analyze the music playlist database. Here I examine the dataset with POSTGRESQL and help the store understand its business growth by answering simple questions.




1. Who is the senior most employee based on job title?

2. Which countries have the most Invoices?

3. What are top 3 values of total invoice?

4. Which city has the best customers? We would like to throw a promotional Music Festival in the city we made the most money. Write a query that returns one city that has the highest sum of invoice totals. Return both the city name & sum of all invoice totals

5. Who is the best customer? The customer who has spent the most money will be declared the best customer. Write a query that returns the person who has spent the most money.
           
6. Write query to return the email, first name, last name, & Genre of all Rock Music listeners. Return your list ordered alphabetically by email starting with A

7. Let's invite the artists who have written the most rock music in our dataset. Write a query that returns the Artist name and total track count of the top 10 rock bands

8. Return all the track names that have a song length longer than the average song length.
Return the Name and Milliseconds for each track. Order by the song length with the longest songs listed first

9. Find how much amount spent by each customer on artists? Write a query to return
customer name, artist name and total spent
